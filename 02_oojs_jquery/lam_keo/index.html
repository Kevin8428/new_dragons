      There are 5 main characters in the show. There names are Jess, Nick, Winston, Schmidt, and CeCe.
      They all live in a loft with each other and have to learn how to adapt to all of their unique personalities.
      They're mostly awkward. CeCe is the only one that doesn't live in the loft but plays Jess's best friend
      and Schmidt's love interest.
